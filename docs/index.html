  <h1>Sorry, this website is currently down.</h1>
  <p>We apologize for the inconvenience. The proxy service that we were using is no longer free, and as a result, we are unable to provide access to the website at this time.</p>
  <p>Hopefully a solution presents itself and we it will be back running soon. Thank you for your patience.</p>
  <p>In the meantime, running the site locally or through docker is completely supported! See the <a href="https://github.com/Colaski/global-streaming-search">Github</a> for more information.</p>
